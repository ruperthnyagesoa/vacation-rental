# Vacation-Rental

**Intro**
Welcome to Vacation-Rental aka Air BnB, the pinnacle of stays, where i put a vintage twist on the vacation rental model.I had a lot of fun implementing the functionality and styling to give it more of a vintage/1990s/earlier days of internet twist. Hope you all like it as well!  

**Frontend**
- I implemented the following features:
- Architectured a smooth component structure to optimize the code applied within my dynamic app
- Employed asynchronous fetches for CRUD functionality for stays & reviews    
- Applied useEffect & useState functionality for fetching the backend data       
- Created the site structure to update based on mobile vs desktop viewing experience

**Backend**
For the backend:
- Involved Ruby, Sinatra & sql to create the stay, review, and user data structures and routes  
- Tested the fetches as needed with binding.pry or Postman to ensure back-end worked appropriately

**Deploy**
To deploy i chose to use Vercel for my front end and Heroku for my backend. I updated my build, fetches, functionality, etc. to ensure a smooth user experience.
